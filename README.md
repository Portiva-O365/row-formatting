## Notes
- If you create or maintain the JSON code, use a JSON editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This will make life much easier!

- Use the _Preview_ mode **extensively**, it will show mistakes in JSON immediately. Wrongly formatted JSON will not be parsed and generates an error message below the JSON box. It will not show you were the mistake is made. Using a code editor like the one mentioned before is more likely to show you erros in parsed JSON code.
